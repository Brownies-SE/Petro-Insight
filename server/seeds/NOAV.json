COGCC staff observed erosion and sediment migration throughout the location including the fill and cut slopes. The erosion included movement of sediment, gravel, and cobbles that moved down the unstabilized slopes. Slash and other debris had been pushed off location. Stormwater BMPs appeared to consist of straw wattles at limited locations at the base of the fill slope. The wattles were not installed properly, nor were they used in a correct situation, and have not been maintained. Sediment deposition including silt, sand, cobbles, and boulders are moving off the fill slope and onto previously undisturbed surface areas that should not have been disturbed. Fill slopes were not stabilized. Structures that appear to have been intended to be stormwater BMPs have been overwhelmed by sloughing of sediment, gravel, and cobbles from the fill slopes. These structures were not installed or maintained correctly. A natural spring on the east side of the Location had been channeled into a French drain running to a perimeter ditch. The perimeter ditch had not been properly constructed. Fluids from this French drain discharge to a fill slope where fluids infiltrate into soil, thus further destabilizing the fill slopes.

implement and maintain Best Management Practices (“BMPs”) at all oil and gas locations to control stormwater runoff in a manner that minimizes erosion, transport of sediment offsite, and site degradation; and shall maintain BMPs until the facility is abandoned and final reclamation is achieved pursuant to Rule 1004. Operator shall employ BMPs, as necessary to comply with this rule, at all oil and gas locations, including, but not limited to, well pads, soil stockpiles, access roads, tank batteries, compressor stations, and pipeline rights of way. BMPs shall be selected based on site-specific conditions, such as slope, vegetation cover, and proximity to water bodies, and may include maintaining in-place some or all of the BMPs installed during the construction phase of the facility. Where applicable based on site-specific conditions, operators shall implement BMPs in accordance with good engineering practices,includingmeasuressuchas: erosion controls designed to minimize erosion from unpaved areas, including operational well pads, road surfaces and associated culverts, stream crossings, and cut/fill slopes. Best Management Practices indicate that Operator shall implement such protection upon commencement of construction. \r\n\r\nOn October 10, 2017, Operator submitted a Form 42, Notice of Construction of a New Location (Document No. 401425452), to notify COGCC of the October 12, 2017, start of construction for the Grynberg Stateline Federal 24-12-65-4-NH Pad, (ID 441995, “Location”). COGCC Staff (“Staff”) conducted an inspection on October 24, 2017, (Field Inspection Report No. 682402931), and observed that Operator was in the process of constructing the Location. Staff observed wind erosion resulting in soil particle deposition off Location to the northeast, east, and southeast of the Location. \r\n\r\nStaff observed Operator was beginning to install temporary stormwater BMPs (straw wattles) on the date of the inspection, two weeks after the noticed start of construction. Staff notes that straw wattle BMPs are temporary BMPs, unsuitable to be used alone without other BMPS, and not functional for preventing wind erosion. Staff observed Operator installing the straw wattles along the southeast of the Location, and did not observe any other BMPs installed or being implemented during the time of the October 24, 2017, inspection. Due to wind erosion, exposed soil particles are vulnerable to possible movement by stormwater. Additionally, established vegetation was being buried and likely damaged by the wind erosion soil particle deposition. \r\n\r\nBetween November 2017 and April 2018, Operator submitted two responses to COGCC inspections, in which it stated it had completed the required corrective actions; and COGCC conducted three follow up inspections, in which it observed that the corrective actions had not been adequately completed (Field Inspection Report Response Nos. 401464651, 401594057; Field Inspection Report Nos. 682403162, 682403410, 682403487).\r\n\r\nIn these inspections, Staff observed that wind erosion continued to result in soil particle deposition off Location to the northeast, east, southeast, and south of the Location; and that this erosion and deposition were worse in each successive inspection. The soil particle deposition off Location from wind erosion of the Location was easily observed over one hundred feet east of the Location perimeter. The wind erosion of the Location was the result of the Operator failing to stabilize the northern and southern well pad areas. Staff observed that the northern and southern portions of the well pad remains unconsolidated, even after the Operator applied the soil binding tacking agent of “Gorilla Snot”.\r\n\r\nStaff also observed that, although Operator had implemented stormwater BMPs in addition to the straw wattles, Operator failed to implement the BMPs in accordance with good engineering practices. The ditch BMP was not properly implemented or maintained given the soil particle accumulation from wind erosion observed by Staff. The sediment trap BMP was not properly implemented given that it was not a sufficient size or constructed in accordance with good engineering practices. \r\n\r\nOperator failed to install stormwater BMPs prior to, or at, the start of construction; and failed to implement BMPs in accordance with good engineering practices, including measures such as erosion controls designed to minimize erosion from unpaved areas, including operational well pads; in violation of Rule 1002.f.(2).\r\n","CorrectiveActionDescription":"Operator shall immediately implement BMPs to control stormwater runoff in a manner that minimizes erosion, transport of sediment offsite, and site degradation.

Though the Peters Well did not have surface casing below the Laramie-Fox Hills Aquifer, a drinking water resource, it is believed the well was in a stable condition. Based on current understanding of area aquifers and hydrocarbon bearing zones, the Peters Well did not have adequate cement to restrict migration of fluids should adjacent horizontal drilling and completion activities occur. \r\nIn 2015, when Highpoint’s predecessor proposed the drilling of the Fox Creek Well, COGCC Staff attached a condition of approval (“COA”) to the Form 2, Application for Permit to Drill (Document No. 400842601), to address the risks presented by drilling and completion activities so close to the Peters Well.The COA read, \"Operator acknowledges the proximity of the listed non-producing well(s). Operator agrees to provide mitigation Option 3 (per the DJ Basin Horizontal Offset Policy), ensure all applicable documentation is submitted, and submit Form 42(s) (\"OFFSET MITIGATION COMPLETED”) for the remediated well(s), referencing the API Number of the proposed horizontal well(s) stating what appropriate mitigation occurred and that it has been completed, prior to the hydraulic stimulation of this well.

The failure to mitigate the Peters Well prior to hydraulic fracturing the Fox Creek Well threatened to cause significant adverse impacts to the ground water resources.\r\nCOGCC Rule 906.c. states, \"[w]hen threatened or actual significant adverse environmental impacts on any air, water, soil or other environmental resource from a spill/release exist or when necessary to ensure compliance with the concentration levels in Table 910-1 with consideration to WQCC ground water standards and classifications, the Director may require operators to submit a Site Investigation and Remediation Workplan, Form 27.\"\r\nOn January 3, 2019, the Director sent a letter requiring HighPoint to initiate an investigation to determine whether actual impacts to the Laramie Fox Hills aquifer have occurred (Document #2193400).Highpoint was given 30 days from receipt of the letter to submit an eForm 27 describing its plan to schedule and investigate the potential impacts.Highpoint received the letter on January 7, 2019 (Document No. 1642228), making the eForm 27 due on or before February 6, 2019.

compaction and, to the extent practicable, from wind and water erosion during drilling and production operations. Best management practices to prevent weed establishment and to maintain soil microbial activity shall be implemented. Additionally, operator shall implement and maintain Best Management Practices (BMPs) at all oil and gas locations to control stormwater runoff in a manner that minimizes erosion, transport of sediment offsite, and site degradation. BMPs shall be maintained until the facility is abandoned and final reclamation is achieved pursuant to Rule 1004. Operators shall employ BMPs, as necessary to comply with this rule, at all oil and gas locations, including, but not limited to, well pads, soil stockpiles, access roads, tank batteries, compressor stations, and pipeline rights of way. BMPs shall be selected based on site-specific conditions, such as slope, vegetation cover, and proximity to water bodies, and may include maintaining in-place some or all of the BMPs installed during the construction phase of the facility.\r\n\r\nBest Management Practices indicate that the operator shall implement such protection upon construction of the new well pad and access road.\r\n\r\nOperator began construction of location (#451421), that is within a sensitive wildlife habitat area, on August 6, 2017 per the submitted Form 42 (Document 401365295).\r\n\r\n--> Rule 1002.c.\r\nAn inspection of the location was conducted on August 15, 2017 Document 680102098). COGCC staff observed that topsoil was not being protected as required by the reclamation rules due to site construction practices and lack of BMPs. Topsoil was not stabilized, therefore has the potential for degradation due to mixing with subsoil, wind/water erosion, and has the potential to become a source of sediment pollution.\r\n\r\n--> Rule 1002.f.\r\nAdditionally, location was not in compliance with the stormwater rules as the BMPs were not installed in accordance with good engineering practices. For instance, no temporary or permanent perimeter stormwater controls were installed at time of inspection. Additionally there was not a stabilized outlet structure or what a appeared to be a properly constructed sediment trap. Standard stormwater good engineering practices require that stormwater BMPs must be implemented prior to, during, and after any construction activities. Location is less than two-tenths of a mile (724 ft) from the nearest down gradient surface water feature. Operator needs to ensure that long term stability of location is not compromised by the cut-slope water seep that exists on location. A second inspection conducted on August 21, 2017, (Document #689400142) noted that there was no evidence of stormwater controls below topsoil at time of inspection.","CorrectiveActionDescription":"Operator shall install and maintain stormwater controls, as well as implement site-specific best management practices to properly store and protect topsoil stockpiles, and control stormwater erosion across the entire location.","CorrectiveDueDate":"11/03/2017","CorrectiveActionComplete":"NOAV resolved by Order 1V-662.

Two and a half months after the unsuccessful test, Operator had neither performed repairs/P&A, nor requested COGCC approval for plans to perform such actions, violating Rule 326.f.","CorrectiveActionDescription":"In its Rule 522.d.(2) Answer, due within 28 days of the Operator’s receipt of the NOAV,OperatorshallprovidethefollowingtoCOGCC:\r\n\r\n- Operator shall perform an audit of its Mechanical Integrity Testing and MIT reporting for all its wells in Colorado.
